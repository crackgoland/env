# env
This package simplifies working with shell environment variables. **Env** provides struct representing environment, 
with support for sourcing `.env` files and ability to **clone** an environment to be used after modifications elsewhere in a program.

An alternative approach for working with envvars is implemented in [kelseyhightower/envconfig](github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) package, 
see example usage [here](https://github.com/nytimes/gizmo/blob/master/pubsub/kafka/config.go).
